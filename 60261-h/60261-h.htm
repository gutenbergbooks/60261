<span class="i0">Not on a single issue, or in one direction or twain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then let us develop this marvellous asset which we alone command,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We have had no end of a lesson: it will do us no end of good!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It was our fault, and our very great faultâand now we must turn it to use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have forty million reasons for failure, but not a single excuse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the more we work and the less we talk the better results we shall getâ<br /></span>

<span class="i0x"><span class="smcap1">No</span> doubt but ye are the Peopleâyour throne is above the Kingâs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoso speaks in your presence must say acceptable things:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowing the head in worship, bending the knee in fearâ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bringing the word well smoothenâsuch as a King should hear.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fenced by your careful fathers, ringed by your leaden seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long did ye wake in quiet and long lie down at ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till ye said of Strife, âWhat is it?â of the Sword, âIt is far from our kenâ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till ye made a sport of your shrunken hosts and a toy of your armed men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye stopped your ears to the warningâye would neither look nor heedâ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye set your leisure before their toil and your lusts above their need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because of your witless learning and your beasts of warren and chase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye grudged your sons to their service and your fields for their camping-place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye forced them glean in the highways the straw for the bricks they brought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye forced them follow in byways the craft that ye never taught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye hindered and hampered and crippled; ye thrust out of sight and away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those that would serve you for honour and those that served you for pay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then were the judgments loosened; then was your shame revealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the hands of a little people, few but apt in the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ye were saved by a remnant (and your landâs long-suffering Star),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When your strong men cheered in their millions while your striplings went to the war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sons of the sheltered cityâunmade, unhandled, unmeetâ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye pushed them raw to the battle as ye picked them raw from the street.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what did ye look they should compass? War-craft learned in a breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowledge unto occasion at the first far view of Death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So! And ye train your horses and the dogs ye feed and prize?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How are the beasts more worthy than the souls your sacrifice?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ye said, âTheir valour shall show themâ; but ye said, âThe end is close.â<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye sent them comfits and pictures to help them harry your foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye vaunted your fathomless power, and ye flaunted your iron pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ereâye fawned on the Younger Nations for the men who could shoot and ride!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then ye returned to your trinkets; then ye contented your souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the flannelled fools at the wicket or the muddied oafs at the goals.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given to strong delusion, wholly believing a lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye saw that the land lay fenceless, and ye let the months go by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting some easy wonder: hoping some saving signâ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Idleâopenly idleâin the lee of the forespent Line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Idleâexcept for your boastingâand what is your boasting worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye grudge a year of service to the lordliest life on earth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ancient, effortless, ordered, cycle on cycle set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life so long untroubled, that ye who inherit forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was not made with the mountains, it is not one with the deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men, not gods, devised it. Men, not gods, must keep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men, not children, servants, or kinsfolk called from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But each man born in the Island broke to the matter of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soberly and by custom taken and trained for the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each man born in the Island entered at youth to the gameâ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it were almost cricket, not to be mastered in haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But after trial and labour, by temperance, living chaste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it were almost cricketâas it were even your play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weighed and pondered and worshipped, and practised day and day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ye shall bide sure-guarded when the restless lightnings wake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the womb of the blotting war-cloud, and the pallid nations quake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, at the haggard trumpets, instant your soul shall leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forthright, accoutred, acceptingâalert from the wells of sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So at the threat ye shall summonâso at the need ye shall send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men, not children or servants, tempered and taught to the end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleansed of servile panic, slow to dread or despise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humble because of knowledge, mighty by sacrifice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ye say, âIt will mar our comfort.â Ye say, âIt will minish our trade.â<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do ye wait for the spattered shrapnel ere ye learn how a gun is laid?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the low, red glare to southward when the raided coast-towns burn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Light ye shall have on that lesson, but little time to learn.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will ye pitch some white pavilion, and lustily even the odds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nets and hoops and mallets, with rackets and bats and rods?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will the rabbit war with your foemenâthe red deer horn them for hire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your kept cock-pheasant keep you?âhe is master of many a shire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arid, aloof, incurious, unthinking, unthanking, gelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will ye loose your schools to flout them till their brow-beat columns melt?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will ye pray them or preach them, or print them, or ballot them back from your shore?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will your workmen issue a mandate to bid them strike no more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will ye rise and dethrone your rulers? (Because ye were idle both?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pride by insolence chastened? Indolence purged by sloth?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No doubt but ye are the People; who shall make you afraid?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also your gods are many; no doubt but your gods shall aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Idols of greasy altars built for the bodyâs ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud little brazen Baals and talking fetishes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teraphs of sept and party and wise wood-pavement godsâ<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>These</em> shall come down to the battle and snatch you from under the rods?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the gusty, flickering gun-roll with viewless salvoes rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pitted hail of the bullets that tell not whence they were sent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ye are ringed as with iron, when ye are scourged as with whips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the meat is yet in your belly, and the boast is yet on your lips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ye go forth at morning and the noon beholds you broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere ye lie down at even, your remnant, under the yoke.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza italic">
<span class="i0">No doubt but ye are the Peopleâabsolute, strong, and wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever your heart has desired ye have not withheld from your eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On your own heads, in your own hands, the sin and the saving lies!</span>

<span class="i0">âOur World is full of wickedness, My Children maim and slay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âAnd the Saint and Seer and Prophet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âCan make no better of it<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">âRise up, rise up, thou Dives, and take again thy gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAnd thy women and thy housen as they were to thee of old.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âIt may be grace hath found thee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âIn the furnace where We bound thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAnd that thou shalt bring the peace My Son foretold.â<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then merrily rose Dives and leaped from out his fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walked abroad with diligence to do the Lordâs desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And anon the battles ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the captives were released,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Earth had rest from Goshen to Gadire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Word came down to Satan that raged and roared alone,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Set each other by the ears,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">âRise up, rise up, thou Satan, upon the Earth to go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAnd prove the peace of Dives if it be good or no:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âFor all that he hath planned<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âWe deliver to thy hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAs thy skill shall serve to break it or bring low.â<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then mightily rose Satan, and about the Earth he hied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathed on Kings in idleness and Princes drunk with pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But for all the wrong he breathed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There was never sword unsheathed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fires he lighted flickered out and died.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then terribly rose Satan, and he darkened Earth afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he came on cunning Dives where the money-changers are;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he saw men pledge their gear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the gold that buys the spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the helmet and the habergeon of war.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yea to Dives came the Persian and the Syrian and the Medeâ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their hearts were nothing altered, nor their cunning nor their greedâ<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And they pledged their flocks and farms<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the king-compelling arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dives lent according to their need.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Satan said to Dives:ââReturn again with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âWho hast broken His Commandment in the day He set thee free,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âWho grindest for thy greed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âManâs belly-pinch and need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAnd the blood of Man to filthy usury!â<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then softly answered Dives where the money-changers sit:â<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âMy refuge is Our Master, O My Master in the Pit;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âBut behold all Earth is laid<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âIn the peace which I have made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAnd behold I wait on thee to trouble it!â<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then angrily turned Satan, and about the Seas he fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shake the new-sown peoples with insult, doubt, and dread;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But for all the sleight he used<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There was never squadron loosed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the brands he flung flew dying and fell dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet to Dives came Atlantis and the Captains of the Westâ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their hates were nothing weakened nor their anger nor unrestâ<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And they pawned their utmost trade<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the dry, decreeing blade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dives lent and took of them their best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Satan said to Dives:ââDeclare thou by The Name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âThe secret of thy subtlety that turneth mine to shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âIt is known through all the Hells<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âHow my peoples mocked my spells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAnd my faithless Kings denied me ere I came.â<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered cunning Dives: âDo not gold and hate abide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAt the heart of every Magic, yea, and senseless fear beside?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âWith gold and fear and hate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âI have harnessed state to state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAnd with hate and fear and gold their hates are tied.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">âFor hate men seek a weapon, for fear they seek a shieldâ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âKeener blades and broader targes than their frantic neighbours wieldâ<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âFor gold I arm their hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âAnd for gold I buy their lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAnd for gold I sell their enemies the yield.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">âTheir nearest foes may purchase, or their furthest friends may lease,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">âIs not Calno like Carchemish? For the steeds of their desire<br /></span>

<span class="i2">âAnd he dare not draw the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âTill Gaza give the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âAnd he show release from Askalon and Gath.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">âWilt thou call again thy peoples, wilt thou craze anew thy Kings?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âLo! my lightnings pass before thee, and their whistling servant brings,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">âEre the drowsy street hath stirredâ<br /></span>
